It appears as connected but most of the buttons do not work (ie Menu, Back, End and 3D) -this all 5 buttons all act like one button - 3D menu option to choose written in German language. Also source button do not work as expected and it reaches Skype option and cannot go any further. (my TV is Sharp 52LE830E) How should I configure Sharp TV properly to make it work? . Any help appreciated.  Moreover: It cannot work when I set username and password in TV - then it can not connect. Only empy username and password is ok. And it shows empy Information in Device Info (only Name is shown the rest is empty)  Anyway - this app is great idea guys and keep up with good work! I hope it becomes much better soon. Thanks!","Sharp Wake Up I have a 60 inch sharp aquos and let me say you would do well sharp to hire some creative & a few developers. WebTV would be nice.

But I see after you buy the app once no more up sells and future updates contain guns usually and are free to the owner. I j ust wish the updates came faster so all three programs can have a full 21 gun assortment like oh the 1st weaphones. Edit:4/10/15 still waiting on a update for #2 & WII anxious as all hell come on guys it's been too long","This app needs a few things... First, it needs a motion to fire the gun via shaking the phone. Second, it needs a sliding trigger feature, as it would be nice on like the snipers. Thirdly, I would like to see more of those minigames like on the first volume. Do this, and this app will be one of the best.","Issue with the S5 Seems to be an issue with my phone, unsure about others but the guns lag to all hell, maybe at like 8 FPS when shot. They run fine otherwise, but gunfire causes obscene lag","Boss but, Needs a little more improvements I love how you guys made it to where the guns are used in \"spec-ops\" ver. But, I think that you could've added some more explosives, spec-ops weapons, and maybe even a ballistic knife. So keep up the good work, maybe people could could even do a role-play weaphones war!! Oh yeah and can you guys please add or try to add slow motion option on all of the guns?","BADASS APP FOR A GUN SIM. Only 1 thing you should add, a vibrate option","Great app but laggy on new phone I bought this gun app a while ago when I used to use it a lot, but I ended up deleting it to save space on my old phone. I saw it today and thought I'd like to reinstall it and see how it ran on my new phone, which is very capable of running it. But the app is really laggy and slow in the menus and the guns themselves, so I cant really use it. Has this been updated for Android 5.0 Lollipop yet? Cause that's what OS I'm running on Motorola Moto G 2nd gen, maybe that's the problem. A fix ASAP would be great!"],"screenshots":["//lh3.ggpht.com/Jc3z6et8whuOQXx-cKEMK-25ZU4JpPQ_zohOxbLAnnflLvt97o7P0Z7vJfnnSspLLg=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/mD0kQPjoTOnYcRkEUtnq9reK8uh6aGOnDmtLsUAjspXWG1hbFLRdhHWW7uSRmMAnM8s=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/DYLRjkFfKPKLM5TlaXQ7DMGQFEIujRoIYhe0Y39tbW5xleBiRY68dMSnzvoyrVNYB6C9=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/q7WPMlzDT-wpjyct4q3N9wmh4HvPUR3ZDOts1YJ0FcrSbMXePuCHDnw7VdiU5-drGMGq=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/vbkmZE5JeMnr30TmHb4a7G1yqdWeSLz-IyvIjPSO-9oi-BQW93pyt-_mLCV6obMG-g=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/trajtQvg9OZv2xCCs8iQvtX2ez5KSjYrxdKLUFFdOSfZk_JTTgNKzfTh9DsvPnjyZg=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/d8z0ac71vOT7f2j6azobHXZ2v5koMLi1Ghkj_BXaWRgxk6IiVoP_DygtAXJGE7rSPYQ=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/oFjeV3QKkkQxFt8harKc7p6-T5Obw2DjzhRsG54lolaQredG1U687zUx6Z7KqHDg2ZE=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/HsUi0g9umUT97nv0iTYpUM7WyHuf266rv68BCspVnExN6u2LHqLVlUWCtzwwKQu0U_Xz=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/utjGBrBLKwnLM6V89_d8mNfWFtpBDrV5mV88D9T868K-QeDWWGHKLRV7Pv2sTQerpQA=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/Wwv4ih_-eb2F-cMEOLlTYQvvBbzdeDWnE3GFL13tdoy66RLOOyhVKMYnkTqUlm0CVQ=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/3DSYT_gjRJWj9dfQoLEdjVvXBG_kNShH1jPO_huomqUarDFOsLNA-O_WmRWD0nTkoIxw=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/UncM0e9LEF7q1LSQ4XqA-I2ADfVfSooHWC722RTiuYEYbR4uDo0k2IxGs8nAyRbGZkdo=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/D9PVETl9LI9omotcL2DPLM8m74m5GZHrIGj-fLBtobzgurhHaNr1bkzJzk0QeXR4zdoP=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/ET6-PFHa9w_3oT5gEFYoftSZQ3r0IKC4wtCJkCe2ujhptS97MGEsmRmR-VsKiVRY2w=h310"],"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.oranginalplan.weaphonesvol2&hl=en&gl=us","appId":"air.com.oranginalplan.weaphonesvol2"}},{"co.smartwatchface.watch.face.ranger.military":{"title":"Ranger Military Watch Face","icon":"//lh3.ggpht.com/LOK9Dp3kC1qWp5D-SrK5Far2jY3NTENdvyLmmvBpL9bdeharUYG0vA_LkGt-Sm4ZLWQ=w300","minInstalls":50000,"maxInstalls":100000,"offersIAP":false,"adSupported":false,"score":4.4,"reviews":5079,"histogram":{"1":171,"2":107,"3":348,"4":1319,"5":3134},"description":"Ranger is a military style watch face for your Android Wear device.

Edit: continuously giving me unnecessary notifications on my watch asking how I'm liking the watch face? ..I've already rated the app - not to mention the fact that I paid money for your work, not spam. Please remove those notifications through an update and I will restore the 5 star rating and remove the edit.","After a few days, features stopped working. The compass and weather don't work. Contacted developer several days ago, and still have had no response.","Stopped working Whats the point of having features like steps and weather if they dont work. Don't get me wrong I love the face but the weather constantly says the same temp and the step count doesnt match with my googlefit or watch app. If your asking people to cough up cash please make sure your stuff works. Ive also recently factory reset my phone and watch and still the same thing happens.","Very well done. Just a couple suggestions This watch face is great. Coupled with my huawei watch, it looks fantastic. Would be awesome to be able to set display brightness based on time. Especially for ambient mode. And pick my own colors for night, non night, and minimal ambient mode.","Great watch face Recent update also brings more accurate and functional weather reporting without the need for location services to be on. Definitely one of the more attractive faces. My only minor gripe is my watch is square, so the face doesn't look as good as it would on a round watch face (but that's not the apps fault).","Like the face; hate the reminders I like the Ranger watch face, it is my go to face on the Moto 360. I HATE the constant needing to rate the face. Would have been 5 star without that."],"screenshots":["//lh4.ggpht.com/vlVrL95tUygLaoIOEiuHJmeDx6Z6MSTEyLFOo_DnxD3pXmwwC3c3TjjR0OYCYZU2Tw=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/fYzq8a8sBS99XKkHWrPL7TWPfLjaLXIngE7TM06UyBHyg4e6fCqwjc6I_639B6FuTQ=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/9j-k8885hi1gA1qZrXAaKMi80OZY9r0F-1rkhxPajdSVqbGOyXWReilUCQWR2zcEog=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/ay0FZMd0gtexiOFAVnIT31kShSg2MCZFH_TaToKopH_--vAXppAYBCL5SaCcTMZyiwzl=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/JNtgiwrdu2dlfM-ZHTGedyhwITvm9yQRFF2v_01c_vSVzsYpTcXBjEMrpHJYmeCMNR85=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/p7NLTswI1dzHpXFVpVyFqsOXUO3jumtbCYjGZKW0GMRY8NNtIzuysqz9IRN8w983jtxt=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/d1_SDKNqYCFYlOD_FT3LsZoA5pRXnaWzk4vLvasQ5papC41Bxh36n-zP7qszHT1iKtQ=h310"],"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.smartwatchface.watch.face.ranger.military&hl=en&gl=us","appId":"co.smartwatchface.watch.face.ranger.military"}}]
